The concept of TDD, Mockito and JUnit were used in the course of the project. The using of mocks reduce dependency from other methods and makes unit testing more effective. Mocking of real services were made by Mockito. In this project some objects were mocked also. It was made to avoid initialization of redundant fields. 
 The search engine was used as a black box, so the ensurance that the system only return BT specific records for non paying customers was implemented in MySearchController. ChargingService hasn't any method to check current balance of customer, so the method was implemented as customer has enough points to receive information. The simple authentication mechanism based on customers email addresses is used before preparing information for premium customer. If there is no such customer in database,  system will return CustomerNotFoundException. Order search results based on surname (ascending order) is implemented in getResults method of MySearchController.
